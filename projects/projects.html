	<h2>Project 1 : Onboarding</h2>
	<hr/>
	<section>
		<p>
		You will create a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new users to join some 
		type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community. Focus on 
		designing for an effortless, engaging entry of personal information; and friendly, frictionless 
		client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this
		project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever
		it is you’re offering, which is not at all an easy task.
		</p>
	<h3>Project Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive web design</li>
		<li>Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience</li>
		<li>Design progressively enhanced page using at least two media queries</li>
		<li>Apply design principles including typography, color, and material design</li>
		<li>Engage in agile, iterative development; documented with plenty of commit comments</li>

				workers. Self-selected teams of 3 students will redesign this website. Additionally, you will
				add a compelling log in page, as if this were an on-line course for sale. Your redesigned should 
				employ sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

					</p>
					<p>
						You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
						welcome to use as a starting point his sample script and recording release
						form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s
